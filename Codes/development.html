        <h3>Achieve Your Goals</h3>
        <p>This chapter emphasized the importance of setting clear, meaningful goals. It explained that success doesn’t happen by chance but through vision, planning, and consistent action.</p>
        <p> For me, this connects deeply to my life as a student in computer science. Sometimes school feels overwhelming, but when I break down my academic and personal goals—like improving my coding skills, building discipline, and even working on my self-expression—they feel achievable. It reminds me that I can’t just drift; I need to know where I want to end up. Writing down my goals, from excelling in my studies to becoming the best version of myself, keeps me focused when distractions pull me away.

        <h3>The Proper Use of Time</h3>
        <p>The book stresses that time is life’s most valuable resource and how we use it determines our future. This resonates with me a lot, because I sometimes struggle with distractions like TikTok, Instagram, and even playing Sims too much. </p>
        <p> While these things bring comfort, I also know they can take time away from building the disciplined, strong, and successful life I want. This chapter challenges me to guard my time better, to dedicate specific hours for studying, improving my vocabulary, practicing programming, and also balancing with hobbies that inspire me creatively. Aligning with this means creating routines and sticking to them, so my time reflects my priorities rather than my impulses.

        <h3>Surround Yourself with the Best People</h3>
        <p>This chapter reminded me of the power of relationships. It says that the people we spend time with influence our thoughts, habits, and future. In my own life, I’ve started realizing how some friendships can drain me, while others push me to grow. I’ve been working on surrounding myself with people who inspire positivity, ambition, and respect, rather than those who bring negativity or drama. Even in love or friendships, I know I value people who are grounded, emotionally mature, and supportive. This chapter reinforces that who I allow into my space matters, and protecting my peace while seeking uplifting connections is essential to my success.

        <h3>Be a Life-Long Learner</h3>
        <p>Here, the focus is on continuously seeking knowledge, growth, and self-improvement. That message hits home because I see education not just as something I do for school, but as part of who I want to become. I’ve always wanted to improve myself—whether it’s through learning to code better, expanding my vocabulary, working on my body movement like dancing, or even creating and expressing myself as an artist. Life-long learning means I never stop investing in myself. Aligning this lesson to my life motivates me to stay curious, to read more, to experiment with new skills, and to treat every challenge as a chance to grow stronger.
