      		<h3>a. Personality Traits </h3>
      		<p><strong>Traits:</strong> Creativity, Introspection, Determination</p>
      		<p><strong>Impact:</strong>These traits allow me to think outside the box when solving programming problems, persist through challenging academic tasks, and reflect on my learning to continuously improve in projects, exams, and class discussions. </p>

    	<!-- Box B -->
    	<div class="personality-box">
     		 <h3>b. Hero / Mentor</h3>
      		<p><strong>Hero:</strong> Nicki Minaj</p>
      		<p><strong>Background:</strong>Nicki Minaj is a rapper, performer, and businesswoman who rose from humble beginnings in Trinidad and Queens, New York, to become a global cultural icon. She is known for her creativity, resilience, and influence in a male-dominated industry.</p>
      		<p><strong>Why My Hero:</strong>I admire her determination, confidence, and ability to embrace individuality. Her journey inspires me to stand out, be ambitious, and combine creativity with discipline in both academic and personal pursuits. </p>
      		<p><strong>Favourite Quote:</strong> “You wanna know what scares people? Success. When you don’t make moves and you don’t climb up the ladder, everybody loves you because you’re not competition. But once you become competition, people hate you.”</p>

    	<!-- Box C -->
    	<div class="personality-box">
      		<h3>c. AI Idea Reflection</h3>
      		<p><strong>Idea Chosen:</strong> AI-Powered Personalized Learning Apps</p>
      		<p>The idea that stood out most to me from the “AI Businesses of 2025” blog was AI-powered Personalized Learning. This technology adapts lessons, quizzes, and activities to each student’s learning style and speed. In my world, it could make studying easier by providing feedback on my weak areas and creating customized study plans. This would save time and help improve my academic performance.</p>
      		<p>However, ethical concerns include data privacy and AI bias, as systems might collect personal data or favor certain learning types. To address this, clear data policies and regular system checks should be in place.An example of this technology is
